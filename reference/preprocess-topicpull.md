# Pull content into topics \(topicpull\)

The `topicpull` step pulls content into `xref` and `link` elements. This step is implemented in XSLT.

If an `xref` element does not contain link text, the target is examined and the link text is pulled. For example, a reference to a topic pulls the title of the topic; a reference to a list item pulls the number of the item. If the `xref` element references a topic that has a short description, and the `xref` element does not already contain a child `desc` element, a `desc` element is created that contains the text from the topic short description.

The process is similar for `link` elements. If the `link` element does not have a child `linktext` element, one is created with the appropriate link text. Similarly, if the `link` element does not have a child `desc` element, and the short description of the target can be determined, a `desc` element is created that contains the text from the topic short description.
