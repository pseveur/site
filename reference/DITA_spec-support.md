# DITA specification support

DITA Open Toolkit 3.1 supports all versions of the OASIS DITA specification, including 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.

-   **[DITA 1.2 support](../reference/DITA_v1-2-support.md)**  
DITA Open Toolkit 3.1 supports the DITA 1.2 specification. While 1.2 is no longer the latest version of DITA, the grammar files \(DTD and XML Schema\) are still included with DITA-OT and content explicitly created for 1.2 continues to work as intended.
-   **[DITA 1.3 support](../reference/DITA_v1-3-support.md)**  
DITA Open Toolkit 3.1 provides processing support for the OASIS DITA 1.3 specification. Initial preview support for this specification was added in version 2.0 of the toolkit; version 2.2 extended this foundation to support key scopes and branch filtering along with additional DITA 1.3 features.
-   **[Implementation-dependent features](../reference/implementation-dependent-features.md)**  
For certain features, the DITA specification allows conforming processors to choose between different implementation alternatives. In these cases, there may be differences in behavior when DITA content is handled by different processors. DITA-OT supports implementation-specific features by applying one or more of the permissible processing approaches.
-   **[Extended codeblock processing](../reference/extended-functionality.md)**  
DITA-OT provides additional processing support beyond that which is mandated by the DITA specification. These extensions can be used to define character encodings or line ranges for code references, normalize indendation, add line numbers or display whitespace characters in code blocks.
-   **[DITA features in the documentation](../reference/DITA-features-in-docs.md)**  
The DITA Open Toolkit uses various recent DITA features in the project documentation.
