# Eclipse help processing

The eclipsehelp transformation generates XHTML-based output and files that are needed to create an Eclipse Help system plug-in. Once the normal XHTML process has run, the `dita.map.eclipse` target is used to create a set of control files and navigation files.

Eclipse uses multiple files to control the plug-in behavior. Some of these control files are generated by the build, while others might be created manually. The following Ant targets control the Eclipse help processing:

-   **`dita.map.eclipse.init`**

    Sets up various default properties

-   **`dita.map.eclipse.toc`**

    Creates the XML file that defines an Eclipse table of contents

-   **`dita.map.eclipse.index`**

    Creates the sorted XML file that defines an Eclipse index

-   **`dita.map.eclipse.plugin`**

    Creates the plugin.xml file that controls the behavior of an Eclipse plug-in

-   **`dita.map.eclipse.plugin.properties`**

    Creates a Java properties file that sets properties for the plug-in, such as name and version information

-   **`dita.map.eclipse.manifest.file`**

    Creates a MANIFEST.MF file that contains additional information used by Eclipse

-   **`copy-plugin-files`**

    Checks for the presence of certain control files in the source directory, and copies those found to the output directory

-   **`dita.map.eclipse.fragment.language.init`**

    Works in conjunction with the `dita.map.eclipse.fragment.language.country.init` and `dita.map.eclipse.fragment.error` targets to control Eclipse fragment files, which are used for versions of a plug-in created for a new language or locale


Several of the targets listed above have matching templates for processing content that is located outside of the scope of the map directory, such as `dita.out.map.eclipse.toc`.
