# HTML5 processing

After the HTML5 files are generated, the html5 transformation generates a table of contents \(ToC\) file called index.html, which can be loaded as a cover page or rendered in a navigation sidebar or menu via CSS.

As of DITA-OT 2.2, the nav-toc parameter can be used in HTML5 transformations to embed navigation directly in topics using native HTML5 elements without JavaScript or framesets.
