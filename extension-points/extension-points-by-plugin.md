# Extension points by plug-in

The default plug-ins that ship with the DITA Open Toolkit include a series of extension points that can be used to modify various aspects of toolkit processing.

If your toolkit installation includes custom plug-ins that define additional extension points, you can add topics by rebuilding the DITA-OT documentation.

-   **[Extension points in org.dita.base](../extension-points/extension-points-in-org.dita.base.md)**  
The `org.dita.base` plug-in provides common extension points that are available to extend processing in all transformations that are supported by the DITA Open Toolkit.
-   **[Extension points in org.dita.eclipsehelp](../extension-points/extension-points-in-org.dita.eclipsehelp.md)**  
Certain extension points are specific to the Eclipse Help transformation.
-   **[Extension points in org.dita.html5](../extension-points/extension-points-in-org.dita.html5.md)**  
In addition to the extension points provided by common processing and those shared by with other HTML-based transformations, the `org.dita.html5` plug-in provides extension points that are specific to the HTML5 transformation.
-   **[Extension points in org.dita.htmlhelp](../extension-points/extension-points-in-org.dita.htmlhelp.md)**  
Certain extension points are specific to the HTML Help transformation.
-   **[Extension points in org.dita.pdf2](../extension-points/extension-points-in-org.dita.pdf2.md)**  
Certain extension points are specific to the PDF transformation \(formerly known as “PDF2”\).
-   **[Extension points in org.dita.troff](../extension-points/extension-points-in-org.dita.troff.md)**  
Certain extension points are specific to the troff transformation, which produces output for use with the troff viewer on Unix-style platforms, particularly for programs such as the man page viewer.
-   **[Extension points in org.dita.xhtml](../extension-points/extension-points-in-org.dita.xhtml.md)**  
The `org.dita.xhtml` plug-in provides shared extension points that can be used to modify processing in HTML-based transformation types such as Eclipse help, HTML Help, TocJS, and XHTML.
