# Globalization support offered by the DITA-OT

The DITA Open Toolkit offers globalization support in the following areas: Generated text, index sorting, and bi-directional text.

-   **Generated text**

    Generated text is text that is rendered automatically in the output that is generated by the DITA-OT; this text is not located in the DITA source files. The following are examples of generated text:

    -   The word "Chapter" in a PDF file.
    -   The phrases "Related concepts," "Related tasks," and "Related reference" in HTML output.
-   **Index sorting**

    The DITA-OT can use only a single language to sort indexes.

-   **Bi-directional text**

    The DITA-OT contains style sheets \(CSS files\) that support both left-to-right \(LTR\) and right-to-left \(RTL\) languages in HTML based transformations. PDF supports both LTR and RTL rendering based on the document language. The `@dir` attribute can be used to override the default rendering direction.


When the DITA-OT generates output, it takes the first value for the `@xml:lang` attribute that it encounters, and then it uses that value to create generated text, perform index sorting, and determine which default CSS file is used. If no value for the `@xml:lang` attribute is found, the toolkit defaults to US English. You can use the [configuration.properties](../parameters/configuration-properties.md) to change the default language.
