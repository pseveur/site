# Customizing HTML output

You can adjust the look and feel of your HTML output without creating a DITA-OT plug-in by including custom CSS, headers and footers, or table-of-contents navigation in topics.

-   **[Setting parameters for custom HTML](../topics/html-customization-parameters.md)**  
For simple branded HTML pages, you can adjust the look and feel of the default output to match your company style by setting parameters to include custom CSS, header branding, or table-of-contents navigation in topics. \(These changes do not require a custom plug-in.\)
-   **[Customizing HTML with a .properties file](../topics/html-customization-properties-file.md)**  
You can also use a .properties file to reference a set of build parameters when building output with the dita command. The DITA-OT documentation uses a .properties file to include custom CSS, header branding, and table-of-contents navigation in the HTML5 output.
-   **[Custom HTML plug-ins](../topics/html-customization-plugins.md)**  
For more complex customizations, you can create custom DITA-OT plug-ins that build on the default XHTML and HTML5 transformations, bundle custom stylesheets, modify the HTML markup, or override other aspects of HTML processing.
