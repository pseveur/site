# Building output

You can use either the dita command-line tool or Ant to transform DITA content to the various output formats that are supported by the DITA Open Toolkit.

-   **[Building output using the dita command](../topics/build-using-dita-command.md)**  
You can generate output using the DITA Open Toolkit dita command-line tool. Build parameters can be specified on the command line or with .properties files.
-   **[Building output using Ant](../topics/publishing-with-ant.md)**  
You can use Ant to invoke the DITA Open Toolkit and generate output. You can use the complete set of parameters that are supported by the toolkit.
-   **[DITA-OT transformations \(output formats\)](../topics/output-formats.md)**  
The DITA Open Toolkit ships with several core transformations that generate different output formats from DITA content. Each transformation represents an implementation of the processing that is defined by OASIS in the DITA specification.
