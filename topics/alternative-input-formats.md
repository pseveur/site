# Alternative authoring formats

As of release 3.0, DITA-OT supports several alternative input formats in addition to standard DITA XML, including Markdown and the proposed MDITA and HDITA authoring formats currently in development for Lightweight DITA.

-   **[Markdown content](../topics/markdown-input.md)**  
 [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write using an easy-to-read plain text format and convert to structurally valid markup as necessary.
-   **[Preview support for Lightweight DITA](../topics/lwdita-input.md)**  
DITA-OT provides preview support for the MDITA and HDITA authoring formats proposed for [Lightweight DITA](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/LwDITA/v1.0/cn01/LwDITA-v1.0-cn01.pdf), or “LwDITA”. These proposed formats are alternative representations of DITA content in Markdown or HTML.
-   **[Markdown DITA syntax reference](../topics/markdown-dita-syntax-reference.md)**  
Markdown DITA uses [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org) as the underlying markup language.
