# DITA-OT error messages

This topic lists each error message generated by the toolkit and provides additional information that might be helpful in understanding and resolving the error condition. If your toolkit installation includes custom plug-ins that define additional messages, you can add to this list by rebuilding the DITA-OT documentation.

Each message ID is composed of a message prefix, a message number, and a letter that indicates the severity level \(I, W, E, or F\).

The toolkit uses the following severity scale:

-   **Info \(I\)**

    Informational messages highlight the progress of transformation and call attention to conditions of which you should be aware. For example, draft comments are enabled and will be rendered in the output.

-   **Warning \(W\)**

    The toolkit encountered a problem that should be corrected. Processing will continue, but the output might not be as expected.

-   **Error \(E\)**

    The toolkit encountered a more severe problem, and the output is affected. For example, some content is missing or invalid, or the content is not rendered in the output

-   **Fatal \(F\)**

    The toolkit encountered a severe condition, processing stopped, and no output is generated.


Plug-ins may be used to add additional messages to the toolkit; for more information, see [Rebuilding the DITA-OT documentation](rebuilding-the-dita-ot-documentation.md).

|Message ID|Severity|Message text|Additional details|
|----------|--------|------------|------------------|
|DOTA001F|Fatal|"%1" is not a recognized transformation type. Supported transformation types are dita, eclipsehelp, html5, htmlhelp, markdown, markdown\_gitbook, markdown\_github, pdf, pdf2, tocjs, troff, xhtml.|Default transformation types that ship with the toolkit include dita, eclipsehelp, html5, htmlhelp, markdown variants, pdf \(or pdf2\), tocjs, troff, xhtml, and xhtml. Additional transformation types may be available if toolkit plug-ins are installed.|
|DOTA002F|Fatal|Input file is not specified, or is specified using the wrong parameter.|The input parameter was not specified, so there is no DITA or DITAMAP file to transform. Ensure the parameter is set properly; see [DITA-OT common parameters \(args.input\)](../parameters/parameters-base.md) if you are unsure how to specify the input file.|
|DOTA003F|Fatal|Cannot find the user specified XSLT stylesheet '%1'.|An alternate stylesheet was specified to run in place of the default XSLT output process, but that stylesheet could not be loaded. Please correct the parameter to specify a valid stylesheet.|
|DOTA004F|Fatal|Invalid DITA topic extension '%1'. Supported values are '.dita' and '.xml'.|This optional parameter is used to set an extension for DITA topic documents in the temporary processing directory. Only "dita", ".dita", "xml", or ".xml" are allowed.|
|DOTA006W|Warning|Absolute paths on the local file system are not supported for the CSSPATH parameter. Please use a relative path or full URI instead.|If the CSSPATH uses an absolute path, it should be one that can still be accessed after the files are moved to another system \(such as `http://www.example.org/`\). Absolute paths on the local file system will be broken if the content is moved to a new system.|
|DOTA007E|Error|Cannot find the running-footer file "%1". Please double check the value to ensure it is specified correctly.|The running footer file, which contains content to be added to the bottom of each XHTML output topic, cannot be located or read. This is usually caused by a typo in the parameter value. You should also ensure that the value is not specified with "file:" as a prefix.|
|DOTA008E|Error|Cannot find the running-header file "%1". Please double check the value to ensure it is specified correctly.|The running header file, which contains content to be added to the top of each XHTML output topic, cannot be located or read. This is usually caused by a typo in the parameter value. You should also ensure that the value is not specified with "file:" as a prefix.|
|DOTA009E|Error|Cannot find the specified heading file "%1". Please double check the value to ensure it is specified correctly.|The running heading file, which contains content to be added to the `head` section of each HTML output topic, cannot be located or read. This is usually caused by a typo in the parameter value. You should also ensure that the value is not specified with "file:" as a prefix.|
|DOTA011W|Warning|Argument "%1" is deprecated. This argument is no longer supported in the toolkit.| |
|DOTA012W|Warning|Argument "%1" is deprecated. Please use the argument "%2" instead.| |
|DOTA013F|Fatal|Cannot find the specified DITAVAL '%1'.| |
|DOTA014W|Warning|Attribute @%1 is deprecated. Use attribute @%2 instead.| |
|DOTA066F|Fatal|Cannot find the user specified XSLT stylesheet '%1'.|An alternate stylesheet was specified to run in place of the default XSL-FO output process, but that stylesheet could not be loaded. Please correct the parameter to specify a valid stylesheet.|
|DOTA067W|Warning|Ignoring index-see '%1' inside parent index entry '%2' because the parent indexterm contains indexterm children.|According to the OASIS DITA Specification, the `index-see` element should be ignored if the parent `indexterm` contains other `indexterm` children.|
|DOTA068W|Warning|Ignoring index-see-also '%1' inside parent index entry '%2' because the parent indexterm contains indexterm children.|According to the OASIS DITA Specification, the `index-see-also` element should be ignored if the parent `indexterm` contains other `indexterm` children.|
|DOTA069F|Fatal|Input file '%1' cannot be located or read. Ensure that file was specified properly and that you have permission to access it.|Please ensure that the input file path and file name were entered correctly.|
|DOTA069W|Warning|Target "%1" is deprecated. Remove references to this target from your custom XSLT or plug-ins.| |
|DOTJ005F|Fatal|Failed to create new instance for '%1'. Please ensure that '%1' exists and that you have permission to access it.| |
|DOTJ007E|Error|Duplicate condition in filter file for rule '%1'. The first encountered condition will be used.| |
|DOTJ007W|Warning|Duplicate condition in filter file for rule '%1'. The first encountered condition will be used.| |
|DOTJ009E|Error|Cannot overwrite file '%1' with file '%2'. The modified result may not be consumed by the following steps in the transform pipeline. Check to see whether the file is locked by some other application during the transformation process.|The transform was unable to create files properly during the transform; results may not be as expected.|
|DOTJ012F|Fatal|Failed to parse the input file '%1'.|This message may indicate an invalid input file \(such as accidentally specifying a PDF file as input rather than a DITA map file\), an input file that uses elements which are not allowed, are not part or a DITA file that has errors and cannot be parsed as XML. You could also be using a specialized DITA document type that needs external plug-ins in order to be parsed correctly. The message issued by the XML parser should provide additional information to help diagnose the cause.|
|DOTJ013E|Error|Failed to parse the referenced file '%1'.|This message may indicate a reference to an invalid file \(such as accidentally referencing a PDF or unknown XML file as if it was DITA\), a referenced file that uses elements which are not allowed, or a referenced DITA file that has errors and cannot be parsed as XML. You could also be using a specialized DITA document type that needs external plug-ins in order to be parsed correctly. The message issued by the XML parser should provide additional information to help diagnose the cause.|
|DOTJ014W|Warning|Found an indexterm element with no content. Setting the term to \*\*\*.|An empty `indexterm` element was found, and will appear in the index as \*\*\*. This index term should be removed from the source.|
|DOTJ018I|Info|Log file '%1' was generated successfully in directory '%2'. Any messages from the transformation process are available in the log file; additional details about each message are available in the DITA-OT user guide.| |
|DOTJ020W|Warning|At least one plug-in in '%1' is required by plug-in '%2'. Plug-in '%2' cannot be loaded. Check and see whether all prerequisite plug-ins are installed in toolkit.|This will appear when one installed plug-in requires another in order to function correctly, but the required plug-in is not found. The installed plug-in will be ignored.|
|DOTJ021W|Warning|File '%1' will not generate output since it is invalid or all of its content has been filtered out by the ditaval file. Please check the file '%1' and the ditaval file to see if this is the intended result.|This may appear if filter conditions on the root element of a topic cause the entire topic to be filtered out. To remove this message, you could place any filter conditions on the reference to this file, which will prevent the build from accessing this file.|
|DOTJ022F|Fatal|Failed to parse the input file '%1' because all of its content has been filtered out. This will happen if the input file has filter conditions on the root element, and a ditaval excludes all content based on those conditions.|Either the input file or the ditaval file should change, otherwise your build is explicitly excluding all content.|
|DOTJ023E|Error|Failed to get the specified image file '%1', so it will not be included with your output.|Check whether the image exists in the source location or already exists in the output directory.|
|DOTJ025E|Error|The input to the "topic merge" transform process could not be found. Correct any earlier transform errors and try the build again, or see the DITA-OT User Guide for additional causes.|This message should only appear in the following cases: -   Errors earlier in the transform prevented this step of the transform from running; correct any errors and try the build again.
-   An Ant build or plug-in is directly calling the toolkit's topic merge module, and is doing so improperly; in this case the Ant build or plug-in needs to be fixed.
-   In the past, problems have been encountered when calling this module with an absolute path; this should no longer be an issue, but may be fixed in older releases by updating the Ant build or plug-in.

|
|DOTJ026E|Error|The "topic merge" did not generate any output. Correct any earlier transform errors and try the build again, or see the DITA-OT User Guide for additional causes.|This message should only appear if an Ant build or plug-in is directly calling the toolkit's topic merge module, or if earlier errors resulted in problems with some of the content. If the topic merge module is called correctly, then this indicates a program error that should be reported to the DITA-OT development team via the [GitHub issues tracker](https://github.com/dita-ot/dita-ot/issues).|
|DOTJ028E|Error|No format attribute was found on a reference to file '%1', which does not appear to be a DITA file. If this is not a DITA file, set the format attribute to an appropriate value, otherwise set the format attribute to "dita".|When referencing a non-DITA file, the format attribute should indicate the type of file referenced \(such as "html" for HTML topics or "pdf" for PDF files\). Otherwise, the transform may attempt to parse the referenced document as a DITA topic.|
|DOTJ029I|Info|No 'domains' attribute was found for element '<%1\>'. This generally indicates that your DTD or Schema was not developed properly according to the DITA specification.|The domains attribute is used in specialized DITA documents to help determine which domain elements are legal. This message will only appear if a DITA specialization was not defined properly.|
|DOTJ030I|Info|No 'class' attribute for was found for element '<%1\>'. The element will be processed as an unknown or non-DITA element.|All specialized DITA elements must define a class attribute to provide ancestry information. This message will only appear if a specialized DITA element did not define a class attribute, or if non-DITA elements are included in a DITA context.|
|DOTJ031I|Info|No specified rule for '%1' was found in the ditaval file. This value will use the default action, or a parent prop action if specified. To remove this message, you can specify a rule for '%1' in the ditaval file.|This informational message is intended to help you catch filter conditions that may have been specified improperly; if the value is correct, no action is needed.|
|DOTJ033E|Error|No valid content is found in topicref '%1' during chunk processing. Please specify an existing and valid topic for the topicref.| |
|DOTJ034F|Fatal|Failed to parse the input file '%1' \(the content of the file is not valid\). If the input file '%1' does not have a DOCTYPE declaration, please make sure that all class attributes are present in the file.|DITA processing is based on class attributes defined for every element. Usually these are defaulted in the DTD or Schema; if no DTD or Schema is used, the class attributes must be explicitly included in the map or topic.|
|DOTJ035F|Fatal|The file "%1" is outside the scope of the input dita/map directory. If you want to lower the severity level, please use the Ant parameter 'outer.control', and set the value to "warn" or "quiet". Otherwise, move the referenced file "%1" into the input dita/map directory.|This will appear when a topic is outside the scope of the map; for example, if the main input map references "../other-directory/some.dita". The result would cause an output file to be created outside of the output directory. See [DITA-OT common parameters \(outer.control and generate.copy.outer\)](../parameters/parameters-base.md) for details.|
|DOTJ036W|Warning|The file "%1" is outside the scope of the input dita/map directory.|This will appear when a topic is outside the scope of the map; for example, if the main input map references "../other-directory/some.dita". The result would cause an output file to be created outside of the output directory. If you do not want to see the warning message, please use the Ant parameter 'outer.control', and set the value to "quiet". Otherwise, move the referenced file into the input dita/map directory. See [DITA-OT common parameters \(outer.control and generate.copy.outer\)](../parameters/parameters-base.md) for details.|
|DOTJ037W|Warning|The XML schema and DTD validation function of the parser is turned off. Please make sure the input is normalized DITA with class attributes included, otherwise it will not be processed correctly.|DITA processing is based on class attributes defined for every element. Usually these are defaulted in the DTD or Schema; if validation against the DTD or Schema is turned off, the class attributes must be explicitly included in the map or topic.|
|DOTJ038E|Error|The tag "%1" is specialized from unrecognized metadata. Please make sure that tag "%1" is specialized from an existing metadata tag in the core DITA vocabulary.|This appears to indicate an error in creating specialized metadata elements. Please verify that the document type you are using is complete and complies with DITA Specialization rules.|
|DOTJ039E|Error|There is no target specified for conref push action "pushafter". Please add <elementname conref="pushtarget" conaction="mark"\> before current element.|Please see the topic on [Conref Push](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/os/part1-base/langRef/attributes/theconactionattribute.html#theconactionattribute) in the DITA specification for details on expected syntax for this function.|
|DOTJ040E|Error|An element uses the attribute conaction="replace", but a conref attribute is not found in the expected location.|Please see the topic on [Conref Push](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/os/part1-base/langRef/attributes/theconactionattribute.html#theconactionattribute) in the DITA specification for details on expected syntax for this function.|
|DOTJ041E|Error|The attribute conref="%1" uses invalid syntax. The value should contain '\#' followed by a topic or map ID, optionally followed by '/elemID' for a sub-topic element.|The conref attribute must be a URI reference to a DITA element. Please see the topic on [URI-based addressing](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/os/part1-base/archSpec/base/uri-based-addressing.html#uri-based-addressing) in the DITA specification for details on the expected syntax.|
|DOTJ042E|Error|Two elements both use conref push to replace the target "%1". Please delete one of the duplicate "replace" actions.|The conref push function was used to replace a single element with two or more alternatives. Only one element may directly replace another using conref push. See [Conref Push](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/os/part1-base/langRef/attributes/theconactionattribute.html#theconactionattribute) in the DITA specification for more information about the conref push "replace" function.|
|DOTJ043W|Warning|The conref push function is trying to replace an element that does not exist \(element "%1" in file "%2"\).|The target for a conref push action does not exist; please make sure that the syntax is correct and that the target exists. See the topic on [URI-based addressing](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/os/part1-base/archSpec/base/uri-based-addressing.html#uri-based-addressing) in the DITA specification for details on the expected syntax. If the syntax is correct, it is possible that the target was filtered out of your build using a DITAVAL file.|
|DOTJ044W|Warning|There is a redundant conref action "pushbefore". Please make sure that "mark" and "pushbefore" occur in pairs.|Please see the topic on [Conref Push](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/os/part1-base/langRef/attributes/theconactionattribute.html#theconactionattribute) in the DITA specification for details on expected syntax for this function.|
|DOTJ045I|Info|The key "%1" is defined more than once in the same map file.|This informational message is intended to help you catch catch duplicate key definitions; if the keys are defined as expected, no action is needed.|
|DOTJ046E|Error|Conkeyref="%1" can not be resolved because it does not contain a key or the key is not defined. The build will use the conref attribute for fallback, if one exists.|See [the conkeyref definition](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/os/part1-base/langRef/attributes/theconkeyrefattribute.html#theconkeyrefattribute) for details on expected syntax and usage.|
|DOTJ047I|Info|Unable to find key definition for key reference "%1" in root scope. The href attribute may be used as fallback if it exists|This message is intended to help you locate incorrectly specified keys; if the key was specified correctly, this message may be ignored.|
|DOTJ048I|Info|Unable to find key definition for key reference "%1" in scope "%2". The href attribute may be used as fallback if it exists| |
|DOTJ049W|Warning|The attribute value %1="%3" on element "%2" does not comply with the specified subject scheme. According to the subject scheme map, the following values are valid for the %1 attribute: %4|A DITA Subject Scheme map was used to limit values that are available to the specified attribute. Please correct the attribute so that it uses one of the allowed values.|
|DOTJ050W|Warning|Found an <index-see\> or <index-see-also\> reference to the term '%1', but that term is not defined in the index.|The Eclipse index will contain a value such as "See also otherEntry", but otherEntry does not exist in this index. The index reference will be broken unless this plug-in is *always* loaded into Eclipse with another plug-in that defines otherEntry as an index term.|
|DOTJ051E|Error|Unable to load target for coderef "%1".|The target for a coderef element, which specifies an external text-based file, could not be located or loaded. Please verify that the reference is correct. Note that for security reasons, references to code samples outside of the scope of the map directory are not supported by default, as this could allow a reference to access and display any restricted or hidden file on the system. If you are certain that the path is valid and the file should be loaded, the current workaround is to set a parameter to allow these references. See [DITA-OT common parameters \(outer.control and generate.copy.outer\)](../parameters/parameters-base.md) for details.

|
|DOTJ052E|Error|Code reference charset "%1" not supported. See the DITA-OT User guide for supported charset values on the format attribute.|The DITA-OT supports a special syntax on coderef elements to specify the character set of the target document. See [Extended codeblock processing](../reference/extended-functionality.md) for details on the expected syntax.|
|DOTJ053W|Warning|Input file '%1' is not valid DITA file name. Please check '%1' to see if it is correct. The extensions ".dita" or ".xml" are supported for DITA topics.|By default, the DITA-OT supports the extensions "dita" and "xml" for DITA topics, as mandated by the DITA Specification. Please verify that your topics use one of these extensions, or configure the toolkit to allow additional extensions.|
|DOTJ054E|Error|Unable to parse invalid %1 attribute value "%2"|This message indicates that the `@href` value specified in %1 does not use proper URI syntax. This may occur when `@href` includes characters that should be escaped \(such as the space character, which should be `%20` when in a URI\). In strict processing mode this will cause a build failure; in other processing modes the build will continue using the value in %2.|
|DOTJ055E|Error|Invalid key name "%1".| |
|DOTJ056E|Error|Invalid xml:lang "%1".| |
|DOTJ057E|Error|The id attribute value "%1" is not unique within the topic that contains it.| |
|DOTJ058E|Error|Both %1 and %2 attributes defined. A single element may not contain both generalized and specialized values for the same attribute.| |
|DOTJ059E|Error|Invalid key scope name "%1".| |
|DOTJ060W|Warning|Key "%1" was used in conkeyref but is not bound to a DITA topic or map. Cannot resolve conkeyref value "%2" as a valid conref reference.| |
|DOTJ061E|Error|Topic reference target is a DITA map but format attribute has not been set. Set format attribute value to "ditamap".| |
|DOTJ062E|Error|Invalid %1 attribute value "%2".| |
|DOTJ063E|Error|The cols attibute is "%1" but number of colspec elements was %2.| |

|DOTJ066E|Error|No id attribute on topic type element %1. Using generated id %2.| |
|DOTJ067E|Error|No id attribute on topic type element %1.| |
|DOTJ068E|Error|Conref action "mark" without conref target.|A conref "mark" action has been used to mark a target element without a corresponding content reference target. This may occur when the order of the "mark" element and the pushed element is reversed.|
|DOTJ069E|Error|Circular key definition %1.| A circular reference was found in key definitions: a series of key references where the last key references the first.

 This may occur if a `topicref` element contains both a key name in the `@keys` attribute and a reference to the same key in the `@keyref` attribute, or if a `@keyref` attribute points to a key that refers back to the referencing element.

 To resolve this issue, change the target of the `@keyref` so the key is defined by pointing to a resource other than itself.

 |
|DOTJ070I|Info|Invalid 'class' attribute '%1' for was found for element '<%2\>'. The element will be processed as an unknown or non-DITA element.| When a `@class` attribute does not use the expected syntax, this usually indicates that `@class` has been explicitly set on a DITA element. The attribute should be removed from the document so that the expected default value can be automatically used.

 If this is a non-DITA element, it needs to be placed inside a `foreign` element so that is not validated against DITA rules.

 |
|DOTJ071E|Error|Cannot find the specified DITAVAL '%1'.| Ensure that the DITAVAL file exists. If more than one DITAVAL file is specified, ensure that the paths are delimited using the file path separator character appropriate for your operating system \(semicolon ‘`;`’ on Windows, or colon ‘`:`’ on macOS or Linux\).

Add a mapping between default language and desired language for the string '%1'.|This build uses generated text, such as the phrase "Related information" \(which is generated above many link groups\). The toolkit was unable to locate the string %1 for your specified language, so the string will appear in the default language. This generally indicates that the toolkit's strings need to be updated to support your language, or that your language setting is incorrect.|
|DOTX002W|Warning|The title element or attribute in the ditamap is required for Eclipse output.|The Eclipse help system requires a title in the project files generated from your map. Please add a title to your input map to get valid Eclipse help output.|
|DOTX003I|Info|The anchorref attribute should either reference another dita map or an Eclipse XML TOC file. The value '%1' does not appear to reference either.|Eclipse uses anchor references to connect with other TOC files. For this to work in content generated from a DITA map, the anchorref element must reference either an existing Eclipse TOC XML file, or another DITA map \(which will presumably also be converted to an Eclipse TOC\).|
|DOTX004I|Info|Found a navref element that does not reference anything. The navref element should either reference another dita map or an Eclipse XML file.|Eclipse builds use DITA's `navref` element to pull in other Eclipse TOC files. The build found a `navref` element that does not reference any other file; the element will be ignored.|

|DOTX041W|Warning|Found more than one title element in a %1 element. Using the first one for the %1's title.|Because of the way XML and DITA are defined, it is generally not possible to prohibit adding a second title to a section during editing \(or to force that title to come first\). However, the DITA specification states that only one title should be used in a section. When multiple titles are found, only the first one will appear in the output.|

If you are referencing an actual HTML file that will not be available, it cannot be included in the project, and you should set the toc attribute to "no" on your topicref element. Otherwise, check to be sure your HTML file was included in the CHM; if it was not, you will need to place it in the correct location with your other output files and recompile.|

The requested string could not be found in any language. Your output may contain a meaningful string, or it may contain a code that was intended to map to a string. This likely indicates an error in a plug-in or XSL override; either the string was requested incorrectly, or you will need to provide a mapping for the string in all of the languages you require.|
|DOTX053E|Error|A element that references another map indirectly includes itself, which results in an infinite loop. The original map reference is to '%1'.|This will occur if a map references another map, and then that second map \(or another further nested map\) references the original map. The result is an infinite nesting of maps; please correct the chain of map references to remove circular reference.|
|DOTX054W|Warning|Conflict text style is applied on the current element based on DITAVAL flagging rules. Please check ditaval and dita source to make sure there is no style conflict on the element which needs to be flagged.|This will occur when a DITAVAL file contains multiple styling rules that apply to the same element.|
|DOTX055W|Warning|Customized stylesheet uses deprecated template "flagit". Conditional processing is no longer supported using this template. Please update your stylesheet to use template "start-flagit" instead of deprecated template "flagit".|The "flagit" named template was deprecated in DITA-OT version 1.4, when the OASIS standard formalized the DITAVAL syntax. The template is removed in DITA-OT 1.6. Stylesheets that used this template need to be updated.|
|DOTX056W|Warning|The file '%1' is not available to resolve link information.|The build attempted to access the specified file in order to retrive a title or short description, but the file could not be found. If the file exists, it is possible that a DITAVAL file was used to remove the file's contents from the build. Another possibility is that the file is located outside of the scope of the main input directory, and was not available because the [onlytopic.in.map](../parameters/parameters-base.md) parameter was specified. Be aware that the path information above may not match the link in your topic.|
|DOTX057W|Warning|The link or cross reference target '%1' cannot be found, which may cause errors creating links or cross references in your output file.|The link appears to use valid syntax to reference a DITA element, but that element cannot be found. Please verify that the element exists, and is not removed from the build by DITAVAL based filtering.|
|DOTX058W|Warning|No glossary entry was found associated with key '%1' on %2 element. The build will try to determine the best display text and hover text for terms and abbreviations.|Processing for terms, acronyms, or abbreviated forms will associate the key from the element's keyref attribute with a glossentry \(glossary entry\) topic. This message will appear if the key was defined, but was not associated with a glossentry topic. The process will try to use the best available fallback \(usually the title of the referenced topic\).|
|DOTX060W|Warning|Key '%1' was used in an abbreviated-form element, but the key is not associated with a glossary entry. Abbreviated-form should ONLY be used to reference to a glossary entry.|Processing for abbreviated form elements will associate the key from the element's keyref attribute with a glossentry \(glossary entry\) topic. This message will appear if the key was defined, but was not associated with a glossentry topic. This element is only supported with keys that are associated with glossary topics; the element will not generate any output. Please correct the reference, or use a different element to reference your topic.|
|DOTX061W|Warning|ID '%1' was used in topicref tag but did not reference a topic element. The href attribute on a topicref element should only reference topic level elements.|According to the DITA Specification, references from maps should either go to DITA Maps, DITA Topics, or any non-DITA resource. References below the topic level should only be made from cross references \(using `xref` or similar\) inside of a topic. For details, see the href attribute description in the OASIS standard's definition of the [topicref element](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/topicref.html).|

|DOTX063W|Warning|The dita document '%1' is linked to from your content, but is not referenced by a topicref tag in the ditamap file. Include the topic in your map to avoid a broken link.|This will appear when generating PDF or ODT output that includes a link to a local topic, but the referenced topic is not part of the map itself. This will result in a broken link. You should include the topic in your map or remove the link from the build.|
|DOTX064W|Warning|The copy-to attribute \[copy-to="%1"\] uses the name of a file that already exists, so this attribute is ignored.|The copy-to attribute is used to copy a topic over a document that already exists. Please make sure that any copy-to attributes use a unique name so that the copy will not overwrite existing content.|
|DOTX065W|Warning|Two unique source files each specify copy-to="%2", which results in a collision. The value associated with href="%1" is ignored.|Two different topics are copied to the same location using copy-to; as a result, one of these files would be over-written. Only the first instance of this copy-to value will be recognized. Please correct the use of copy-to attributes.|
|DOTX066W|Warning|Template "%1" is deprecated. Remove references to this template from your custom XSLT or plug-ins.|This message indicates that your custom XSLT or plug-ins rely on templates that will be removed in an upcoming release. Typically this occurs when a named template has been converted to a mode template; any code that uses the deprecated template should be updated.|
|DOTX067E|Error|No string named '%1' was found for language '%2'. Add a mapping for the string '%1'.|This PDF build uses generated text, such as the phrase "Related information" \(which is generated above many link groups\). The toolkit was unable to locate the string %1 for your specified language, so the string will appear in the default language. This generally indicates that the toolkit's strings need to be updated to support your language, or that your language setting is incorrect.|
