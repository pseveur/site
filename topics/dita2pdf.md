# PDF

The pdf transformation generates output in Portable Document Format.

This transformation was originally created as a plug-in and maintained outside of the main toolkit code. It was created as a more robust alternative to the demo PDF transformation in the original toolkit, and thus was known as PDF2. The plug-in was bundled into the default toolkit distribution with release 1.4.3.

To run the PDF transformation, set the transtype parameter to pdf, or pass the --format=pdf option to the dita command line.

```
dita-ot-dir/bin/dita --input=input-file --format=pdf
```

where:

-   dita-ot-dir is the DITA-OT installation directory.
-   input-file is the DITA map or DITA file that you want to process.
