# Adding an Ant target to the pre-processing pipeline

You can add an Ant target to the pre-processing pipeline. This enables you to insert additional processing before or after the pre-processing chain or a specific step in the pre-processing operation.

You can use the `depend.preprocess.pre` and `depend.preprocess.post` extension points to run a target before or after the entire pre-processing operation. In addition, there are extension points that enable you to run an Ant target before specific pre-processing steps.

**Tip:** For maximum compatibility with future versions of DITA-OT, most plug-ins should use the extension points that run **before** or **after** pre-processing.

1.   Define and integrate the new Ant target. 
2.   Create the following plugin.xml file: 

    ```
    <plugin id="plugin-id">
      <feature extension="extension-point" value="Ant-target"/>
    </plugin>
    ```

    where

    -   plugin-id is the plug-in identifier.
    -   extension-point is a pre-processing extension point.
    -   Ant-target is the name of the Ant target.
3.   Install the plug-in. 

The new target is added to the Ant dependency list. The new target is now always run in conjunction with the specified step in the pre-processing pipeline.

## Example

The following plugin.xml file specifies that the myAntTargetBeforeChunk target is always run before the `chunk` step in the pre-processing stage.

```
<plugin id="com.example.extendchunk">
  <feature extension="depend.preprocess.chunk.pre" 
           value="myAntTargetBeforeChunk"/>
</plugin>
```

It assumes that the myAntTargetBeforeChunk target has already been defined and integrated.

CAUTION:

The internal order of preprocessing steps is subject to change between versions of DITA-OT. New versions may remove, reorder, combine, or add steps to the process, so the extension points **within** the preprocessing stage should only be used if absolutely necessary.
