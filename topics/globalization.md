# Globalizing DITA content

The DITA standard supports content that is written in or translated to any language. In general, the DITA Open Toolkit passes content through to the output format unchanged. The DITA-OT uses the values for the `@xml:lang` and `@dir` attributes that are set in the source content to provide globalization support.

-   **[Globalization support offered by the DITA-OT](../topics/globalization-support.md)**  
The DITA Open Toolkit offers globalization support in the following areas: Generated text, index sorting, and bi-directional text.
-   **[Customizing generated text](../topics/plugin-addgeneratedtext.md)**  
Generated text is the term for strings that are automatically added by the build, such as "Note" before the contents of a `note` element.
-   **[Supported languages](../topics/globalization-languages.md)**  
The following languages are supported for all PDF, XHTML, and HTML5-based transformation types.
