# Configuring

You configure components to set up or refine your solution.

You don't have to get the best configuration the first time. Instead, you might start with a simple configuration and then refine it gradually as needed.

-   **[Configuring hard storage devices](../taskbook/configurestorage.md)**  
Most hard disks do not need any configuring. If they do, the instructions are relatively simple.
-   **[Configuring your Web Server](../taskbook/configurewebserver.md)**  
Configuring your Web Server can be as complex or as simple as you want it to be.
-   **[Configuring a Database](../taskbook/configuredatabase.md)**  
Follow these instructions to properly configure your database.
