Installing a Web Server may sound tricky, but it is quite simple if you follow our instructions.

-   **[Close all of your programs](../taskbook/closeprograms.md)**  
You need to shut down everything else before installing major programs
-   **[Run Setup.exe](../taskbook/runsetup.md)**  
As with any major program, you will need to run setup in order to install it.
-   **[Restart your system](../taskbook/restart.md)**  
This is standard procedure after installing any new software.
